## Overview & Description

Greeting Application in a project with the intention of applying the following frontend and backend methodologies and technologies as a part of learning MERN Stack,...

- HTML, CSS: For creating a user interactive GUI
- Forms, Overlays: For creating pop-ups to enrich the user experience.
- Javascript: For handling frontend operations with to handle user interactions, connection to backend frameworks, DOM Manupulation,... etc
- Fetch API: Is a inbuilt JS functionality that provide developers operations to handle data from external or backend servers.
- HTML Id's & Classes: To form a blue print of the application and pave the path to use DOM & Event Handlers
- DOM Manupulation & Event Handlers: To user the html tags and the data collected through it when a certain events such as clicks, submit button, mouse hover, mouse focus, keyboard input,... etc.
- REST API: Representational state transfer is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Enabling clients to make request to the backend server using HTTP Requests.
- CRUD Operations: Implementing Create, Read, Update and Delete operations on the backend servers using REST API
- MVC Model: Following the principle of Models, Views and Controllers to organize the backend software application, with routes and services also being a part of this model
- Node js: The main backend framework to implement buisness logic and handle servers. Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices
- Express js: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- MongoDB: MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- Mongoose: Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
- PostMan: Postman is a popular API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses.
- Joi Library: For Input validation at the backend.
- Body-parser: Parsing the request data in to JSON objects, which is the requirement for this database.
- CORS: Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
* Githhub: For version control and maintaining project flow. Also, the option to keep the main working code untouched by creating branches while working on new features, refactoring or bug fixes,..etc.
